## âœ… Features
- Add products (Cheese, TV, Scratch Cards, Snacks) with stock tracking
- Validate expiration dates
- Apply flat shipping fee only to shippable items (Cheese, TV)

  * insufficient customer balance;  
* prints a shipment notice (for shippable items) and a detailed receipt.
- Designed using clean OOP principles:
  - Product as abstract base class
  - Shippable interface
  - Inheritance for specific product types

## ðŸ’» Technologies Used
- Java 8+
- Console-based input/output

## ðŸ“¦ Usage
Compile and run the main class to simulate customer interaction with the cart system.

## ðŸ“Œ Note
This project was developed and submitted as part of the Fawry Internship coding task to demonstrate object-oriented design, date handling, and business logic implementation in Java.
